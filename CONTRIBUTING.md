# Contributions Welcome

First off, thank you for considering contributing to this repository! This resource is a very simple project, but has plenty of room for improvement.

If you're just looking for quick feedback for an idea or proposal, feel free to open an
[issue](https://github.com/vimal-ds/flop/issues/new).

Follow the [contribution workflow](#contribution-workflow) for submitting your
changes. If you want to receive high-level but still
commit-based feedback for a contribution, follow the
[request for comments](#request-for-comments) steps instead.

## Contribution Workflow

This project uses the “fork-and-pull” development model. Follow these steps if
you want to merge your changes into the project:

1. Within your fork of
   [flop](https://github.com/vimal-ds/flop), create a
   branch for your contribution. Use a meaningful name.
1. Create your contribution, meeting all
   [contribution quality standards](#contribution-quality-standards)
1. [Create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/)
   against the master branch.
1. Once the pull request is approved, one of the maintainers will merge it.

## Contribution Quality Standards

Your contribution needs to meet the following standards:

- Separate each **logical change** into its own commit.
- Add a descriptive message for each commit. Follow
  [commit message best practices](https://github.com/erlang/otp/wiki/writing-good-commit-messages).
- Document your pull requests. Include the reasoning behind each change, and
  the testing done.
- To the extent possible, follow existing code and documentation style and practices.
